## [Nyang Shaw Bin CV](nyangshawbin.github.io)


A landing page to introduce myself as well as to document my experiences and projects. <br>
I am an aspiring developer (backend) and this webpage was made in an attempt to expose myself to front-end web development and languages such as HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap.

Feel free to check it out! :)
